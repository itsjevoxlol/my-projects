# Plurality Problem Set

## Description

Elections can be conducted in various ways across the world. One of the simplest methods for holding an election is through a system known as "plurality voting" (also referred to as "first-past-the-post" or "winner-takes-all"). In the plurality vote system, every voter casts one vote for their preferred candidate, and the candidate with the greatest number of votes wins the election.

The goal of this is to implement a program that runs a plurality election and determines the winner based on the number of votes each candidate receives.
