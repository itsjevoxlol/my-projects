# Spotify Song Database Queries

## Overview

This project involves querying a SQLite database (`songs.db`) that contains information about the top 100 streamed songs on Spotify in 2018. The database includes details about songs and their artists, such as song names, artist names, and various song attributes like danceability, energy, tempo, and more. Your task is to write SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from this dataset.
